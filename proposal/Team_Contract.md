# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
The team will be meeting once a week on Sundays from 6-8pm. The meeting will be a conference call through discord. At the meetings there will be designated notes taker. The first meeting will start with Aton as the note taker. The note taker will be recording the notes in the shared doc and record the date, duration, and content discussed in the meeting. He will also be leading the meeting. The note taker will be rotated around the team each week. 


2. **Assistance** 
Teammates can contact each other through Discord or the iMessage group chat. This is how we will be asking each other for help and letting each other know status updates. 


3. **Respect** 
Respect is expected to be maintained at all meetings and work sessions. Failure to be respectful to each other would cause one of the other team members to step in and confront the situation. The daily Sunday group recap meetings will allow everyone to explain what they did and there progress for that week. 

## Collaboration
The work distribution will be established in the Sunday meeting for each week. Each week will have about two goals and each goal will be assigned to about two to three people in the group. This will allow everyone not having to do everything on their own and build a sense of teamwork. We plan to do this project one deliverable at a time so we know how to combine and make all the deliverables work well together.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Each member will be expected to work at least 4 hours a week because we will have a 2 hour meeting each week with the additional work necessary to finish your assigned task. When unexpected conflicts or commitments appear the member must communicate it to the rest of the group clearly so that someone else can step in and help out. 


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
All conflicts within the team will be decided through a group discussion that will include our project mentor if necessary. Any issues that may be best decided by majority rule may be done through vote.
